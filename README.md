# Grab my Button

<img src="./public/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" style="border-radius: 10px;" />

My first react game for Desktop. Can you grab my button? Play online with other live players.

> ### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**
>Click on the button that is in perpetual movement. You can see the cursor of other players moving in real time.

## Test locally
To test locally, on have to run **Client Side** and **Server Side**.

```bash
# Terminal for Client Side
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
```bash
# Terminal for Server Side
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Technical information
This game is little challenge for me to develop a mini-game with react in typescript that uses the Websocket for a connection between players in real time.

## In upcoming improvements
[x] Creation of rooms to play with friends<br>
[ ] Ability to obtain a score and share it with other players
